QUESTION DESCRIPTION

Sima Guang was nine years old. He liked to play in his backyard with his friends Wang Wei, Li Na, and Zhang Yong.

One day, the friends were playing in the yard. Wang Wei said, “I bet I can go up to the top of the water vat!” A water vat is a very big clay jar used to keep rain water. But Wang wei failed to win the task. So he need to accept the penalty game conducted by other friends. Penalty technical game contains many technical concepts to implement. Wang wei chooses the task randomly. it contains the question like, Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks. Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array, i.e., both stacks should use the same array for storing elements. Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.

push1(int x) > pushes x to first stack
push2(int x) > pushes x to second stack

pop1() > pops an element from first stack and return the popped element
pop2() > pops an element from second stack and return the popped element

Mandatory declaration is "void push1(int x)", "int pop1()", "int pop2()",void push2(int x)"


INPUT:
The first line of the input must contain number of elements in the array used for stack implementation.
The second line of input must contain elements to be present in first stack
The third line of input must contain elements to be present in second stack

OUTPUT:
pop out the top element from first stack
pop out the top element from second stack
TEST CASE 1

INPUT
3
3 5 2

4 1 2 
8 5 3 
OUTPUT
Popped element from stack1 is 2
Popped element from stack2 is 3
